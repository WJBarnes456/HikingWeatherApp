We have a few changes from the intended design:
1) The map doesn’t show current weather. Drawing layers is hard, and the API we’re using for drawing maps really doesn’t help with that. We've replaced this with bringing up a weather popup on click - it serves a similar function, but doesn't give the at-a-glance benefit of a proper map.
2) Ground conditions are based only on rain probability rather than anything else. There do exist APIs that provide this, but DarkSky isn't one of them, and it's not required to be accurate on this prototype.
3) You can’t add hikes later than 5 days from present. This is due to both time constraints (calendars are another area of JavaFX we'd have to learn and adjust to), along with the fact that JavaFX doesn't provide the built-in calendar functionality we'd want to use in the actual mobile app - we can't just delegate to the built-in calendar.
4) You can't edit or delete hikes. This is solely due to time constraints -- it's not necessary for demonstrating the required functionality, since you can just delete the settings file. All of the required infrastructure is already there, we just need to add front-end UI elements that bind to them.
5) Adjusting settings doesn't actually do anything. This is partially because notifications don't make as much sense on a PC compared to a mobile, and also due to the layout of the controls. This could be changed easily with more time.
6) Geocoding has not yet been implemented. This functionality is provided by GMapsFX however, so it could be added with relatively little effort.
